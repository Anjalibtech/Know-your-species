    <h1>Flora</h1>
    <p>Flora is all the plant life present in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring (indigenous) native plants</p>
    <h2>Endangered</h2>
    <p>Endangered species, any species that is at risk of extinction because of a sudden rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.Endangered plant species can be found all over the world. No matter where they are located, they all share one common factor that is thought to have put them onto the endangered list. None of these plants, flowers or trees is thought to have any commodity value to the human race. They may have in an early era, but their lack of usefulness has not encouraged efforts to promote conservation.</p>
    <h3>5 most Endangered Flora</h3>
    <h4>1.Baobab Tree</h4>
    <p>This tree is an unusual life giving tree. While it may only sprout leafs for 3 months of the year, it stores water in its broad and twisted trunk. The peoples of Madagascar, Africa and India would often build their homes among its roots to survive the dry seasons. Climate change, and over development have destroyed its natural habitat.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0447/0453/files/thumb_aduna_baobab_tree.jpg?5820">
    <h4>2.Monkey Puzzle Tree</h4>
    <p>Native to Chile, it seems odd that the national tree would be on the endangered list, but development and loss of its natural habitat have harmed its wild growth. It was also collected as a popular yard ornament too. Fortunately, it does grow well in conservation, but also is not a high priority endangered plant.</p>

    <h4>3.Dragon Tree</h4>
    <p>These are the large and striking trees that form many people’s images of the African savanna. The trees can grow for thousands of years. As old as they can get, they are no match for severe drought, climate change and development. They are steadily disappearing from the continent</p>

    <h4>4.Bois Dentelle</h4>
    <p>Few people are aware of the existence of this delicate plant with the hanging white blossoms. It has never been highly valued as a commodity, and outside of Mauritius, it is rarely spoken of. The cloud forest where it grows has been invaded by many species of plants that are crowding out this small flower. The Bois Dentelle is one part of what makes the natural world beautiful that is steadily being crowded out.</p>

    <h4>5.Cork</h4>
    <p>This oak tree type is the tree where wine corks, and other items made from cork materials come from. While many environmentalists believed that advocating for alternative wine-stoppers would save cork, the reduced demand for the tree bark has instead begun to cause its demise. With no demand for the bark as a commodity, there is no interest in preserving its habitat or the tree itself.</p>

    <h3>Reasons of endangerement</h3>
    <p>Roughly 99 percent of threatened species are at risk because of human activities alone. The principal threats to species in the wild are:Although some of these hazards occur naturally, most are caused by human beings and their economic and cultural activities. The most pervasive of these threats is habitat loss and degradation—that is, the large-scale conversion of land in previously undisturbed areas driven by the growing demand for commercial agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development.</p>
    <h2>Extinct </h2>
    <p>Extinction is the termination of a kind of organism or of a group of kinds (taxon), usually a species.Extinction of a particular plant species occurs when there are no more individuals of that species alive anywhere in the world - the species has died out. This is a natural part of evolution.</p>
    <h3>5 Extinct Flora</h3>
    <h4>1.Lepidodendron</h4>
    <p>Also known as Scale tree, Lepidodendron was a part of the coral forest area. The name Lepidodendron comes from the Greek lepido, scale, and dendron, tree. It was a giant herb that grew up to 100 feet sometimes. The branches were conical in shape. They did not have seeds. Instead, they reproduced through Spores. By the end of the Mesozoic era, these plants died out.</p>

    <h4>2.Calamites</h4>
    <p>Calamites were medium sized trees that grew in the Carboniferous era. They had hollow stems, and the leaves and the branches were in whorls. They also reproduced through the formation of spores.</p>
    <img src="https://blog.nurserylive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/81967342632257333.jpg">
    <h4>3.Archaefructus</h4>
    <p>Archaefructus are considered to be one of the oldest flowering plants. They belonged to the  Cretaceous age and were densely available in the northern regions of China. These flowering plants, however, lacked sepals or petals, and their reproductive organs were based on the stem of the plant.</p>
    <img src="https://blog.nurserylive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/92751924039934353.jpg">
    <h4>4.Cooksonia</h4>
    <p>Cooksonia were primarily land plants known to have existed on earth about 425 million years ago. They thrived in the present regions of Australia and Britain. They were small and lacked leaves, flowers and roots. They only had slender stalks.</p>
    <img src="https://blog.nurserylive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cooksonia_pertoni-e1471385475582.png">
    <h4>5.Rhynia</h4>
    <p>Rhynia were vascular plants that existed hundreds of years ago and belonged to the bryophytes category of plants. They were bisexual in nature and grew close to the other vascular plants.</p>
    <img src="https://blog.nurserylive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rhynia_reconstruction-e1471385665178.jpg">
    <h3>Reasons of Extinction</h3>
    <p>. The main reasons for plant extinction in both groups of regions are agriculture and urbanization. In hotspot regions, one more threat caused plant extinction were biological invasions of plants and animals penetrated to new habitats and often caused harm to local flora and fauna. In biodiversity coldspots, changes in the hydrological regime of habitats (such as new dams that negatively affect the functioning of water bodies) may also cause plant extinctions.</p>
    <h1>Fauna</h1>
   <p>Fauna is all of the animal life present in a particular region or time. The corresponding term for plants is flora.</p>
   <p>The various human activities have led to their extinction and made them Endangeres.</p>
   <h2>Endangered</h2>
   <p>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction.</p>
   <h3>5 most Endangered Fauna</h3>
   <h4>1.Gorillas</h4>
   <p>Gorillas are fascinating creatures that share 98.3% of their DNA with humans! They are capable of feeling emotions like we do and even behave like us sometimes. There are two species, the Eastern Gorilla and the Western Gorilla, and they both have two subspecies. Three out of four are Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The only one that isn’t is the Mountain Gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, which is considered Endangered.</p>
   <img src="https://onekindplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_zEasternLowlandGorillas.jpg">
   <h4>2.Rhinos</h4>
   <p>The name Rhinocerous comes from two Greek words Rhino and Ceros, which when translated into English mean nose horn.They are used in Traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a status symbol and demonstration of wealth. They are so highly prized that a Javan rhino horn can sell for up to $30,000 per kg on the black market. Because of this, three of the five species of rhinoceros are among the most endangered species in the world: the black rhino, the Javan rhino, and the Sumatran rhino. The Javan rhino is the closest to extinction with only between 46 to 66 individuals left.</p>
   <img src="https://onekindplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/animal-rhino.jpg">
   <h4>3.Sea Turtles</h4>
   <p> Two species of sea turtle are critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Hawksbill Turtles and Kemps Ridley Turtles. Leatherback sea turtles are classified as Vulnerable, though the population is decreasing and several subpopulations are facing extinction. </p>
   <img src="https://onekindplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hawksbill_HH.jpg">
   <h4>4.Saola</h4>
   <p>The Saola is one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. It was first discovered in 1992 in the Annamite Range in Vietnam.The Saola is one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. It was first discovered in 1992 in the Annamite Range in Vietnam.</p>
   <img src="https://onekindplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/az-saola-copyright-protected-small.jpg">
   <h4>5.North Atlantic right whale</h4>
   <p>It was whalers that gave the North Atlantic right whale its name. They are gentle giants that stay close to coasts and spend a lot of time at the surface skim feeding on zooplankton, all of which makes them an easy target and the ‘right whale to hunt'. There are currently only around 400 of them left, and only about 100 breeding females.</p>
   <img src="https://onekindplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NA_right_whale.jpg">
   <h3>Reasons of Endangerement</h3>
   <p>The reasons for these species being Endangered are factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species.
   <h2>Extinct</h2>
   <p>
Extinction of a particular animal species occurs when there are no more individuals of that species alive anywhere in the world - the species has died out. This is a natural part of evolution.<br>

But sometimes extinctions happen at a much faster rate than usual. For example, at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago, a mass extinction caused the death of many different types of animals and plants, including the dinosaurs.</p>
   <h3>5 Extinct Fauna</h3>
   <h4>1.Bramble Cay Melomys</h4>
   <p>These little guys were officially declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2015. Native to Bramble Cay, a small island near the northern side of the Great Barrier Reef, it's reported that the rodents haven't been spotted since way back in 2009.</p>

   <h4>2.The Northern White Rhinoceros</h4>
   <p>The last two living northern white rhino's in existence happen to both be female as the last male died in March of 2018. Sudan, the 45-year old male was under armed guard at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy when he passed away from old age and an infection.

The two females are also unable to give birth, making the likelihood of introducing a new generation of the species highly unlikely. Scientists are working on using harvested sex cells and IVF to bring forth a lab-created northern white rhino.</p>

    <h4>3.The Spix Macaw</h4>
    <p>Thought to be extinct in the wild, the Spix Macaw currently exists in captivity with their numbers in the dismally low 60-80 range. The bird is also referred to as Little Blue Macaw because they're known for their vibrant blue feathers.</p>

    <h4>4.The Thylacine</h4>
    <p>The Thylacine, a carnivore also referred to as the Tasmanian tiger and Tasmanian wolf, was a (mostly) nocturnal marsupial that preyed on rodents and kangaroos.

Although Thylacine's looked fierce, they were actually quite timid and, according to Live Science, "could be captured without a fight." Reports of Thylacine sightings have been so frequent in the past century that it sparked an investigation as to the status of their existence.</p>

    <h4>5.The Passenger Pigeon</h4>
    <p>Estimates say that the passenger pigeon population numbered in the millions—and possibly billions—when the first Europeans began settling in America. MentalFloss reports that Wisconsin was home to largest known nesting site in the late 1800s</p>
    <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/the-now-extinct-passenger-pigeon-is-on-display-at-the-news-photo-1607466889.?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*">
    <h3>Reason for Extinction</h3>
    <p>Humans have caused the extinction of various species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences.</p>
